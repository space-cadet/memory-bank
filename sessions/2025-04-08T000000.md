# Session Log: 2025-04-08T000000

## Session Goals
Initial setup of the Memory Bank system, including creation of core structure and essential files.

## Progress Log

### 2025-04-08 00:00:00
- Created base memory-bank directory structure
- Created sessions directory for time-stamped logs

### 2025-04-08 00:05:00
- Created bootstrap.md with core command definitions
- Defined knowledge management tiers
- Established session system architecture

### 2025-04-08 00:10:00
- Created activeContext.md with current focus and system state
- Created progress.md to track project status
- Created initial session_cache.md for session continuity

## Decisions Made

1. **Tiered Knowledge Structure**
   - Implemented four-tier approach: Bootstrap → Critical → Essential → Reference
   - Bootstrap tier acts as the "kernel" and is always loaded first

2. **Session Management**
   - Using time-stamped session logs to maintain conversation history
   - Creating session_cache.md to manage session continuation

3. **Progressive Loading**
   - Implementing progressive loading to optimize token usage
   - Only loading files that are necessary for the current task
