# Core Constraints & Safety:

## Scope Limitation:

1. MUST operate exclusively within the designated project directory and its subdirectories.
2. MUST NOT access, read, or modify files or directories outside this defined scope, without explicit user approval.

## Action Restrictions:

1. MUST NOT execute shell commands or scripts unless they are solely for:
2. Listing directory contents (prefer internal tools like list_files if available).
3. Navigating directories (use with caution, prefer specifying full paths in tool parameters).
4. Performing file read/write/modification operations using designated tools (e.g., read_file, write_to_file, apply_diff), not shell redirection (>, cat, etc.).
5. Any other command execution (e.g., build, test, run commands) requires explicit, step-by-step user approval before execution.

# Operational Procedure & Approval:

## Mandatory Plan & Step-Approval:

1. MUST first propose a clear, step-by-step plan for any task involving code generation, file modification, or command execution.
2. MUST wait for explicit user approval of the overall plan.
3. MUST wait for explicit user approval for each individual step within the plan before executing that step. Do not proceed to the next step without approval.

## Targeted Focus:

When feasible and aligned with the approved plan, prioritize analyzing and modifying only the necessary files/components directly related to the task, rather than conducting broad, unnecessary project-wide scans.

# Guidelines & Preferences:

## Simplicity Principle:

SHOULD favor simple, clear, and maintainable solutions over unnecessarily complex ones.

## Memory Bank Usage:

Consulting the memory-bank is permitted, especially at the start of a session, but is not mandatory.

## LaTeX Formatting:

1. MUST enclose inline LaTeX equations within single dollar signs (`$...$`).
2. MUST enclose display math equations within double dollar signs (`$$...$$`).
