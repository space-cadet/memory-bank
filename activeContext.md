# Active Context

*Last Updated: 2025-04-08*

## Current Focus

The Memory Bank system is currently in initial setup phase. We're establishing the fundamental structure and core components that will enable session continuity and project knowledge management across multiple chat interactions.

## System State

- Bootstrap system established with core command definitions
- Directory structure created with sessions folder for time-stamped logs
- Initial core files created

## Active Decisions

- Using a tiered approach to knowledge management (Bootstrap → Critical → Essential → Reference)
- Implementing progressive loading to optimize token usage
- Using time-stamped session logs for maintaining conversation history
- Session cache mechanism for continuation across separate chat sessions

## Cross-References

- **Bootstrap System**: [bootstrap.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/bootstrap.md)
- **Project Progress**: [progress.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/progress.md)
- **Sessions Directory**: [/sessions](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/sessions/)

## Current Considerations

- Need to establish clear patterns for session log maintenance
- Need to develop workflow for session transitions
- Need to optimize for minimal token usage during context loading
- Need to implement mechanisms for differential updates

## Next Actions

1. Complete the core memory bank structure implementation
2. Create initial session log mechanism
3. Test the session continuation capabilities
4. Document usage patterns and best practices
5. Implement sample workflows for demonstration
