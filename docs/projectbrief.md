*Last Updated: 2025-04-08*

## Project Vision

Create a robust, efficient Memory Bank system that maintains perfect knowledge of projects across multiple chat sessions with AI assistants. The system will use progressive loading and session caching to optimize token usage while preserving critical context.

## Core Requirements

1. **Persistent Knowledge Across Sessions**
   - Maintain complete project context across multiple chat sessions
   - Support seamless continuation of work from previous sessions
   - Preserve decision history and rationale

2. **Efficient Resource Usage**
   - Implement progressive loading to minimize token usage
   - Use tiered knowledge structure to prioritize critical information
   - Support differential updates to avoid redundant information

3. **Session Continuity**
   - Create time-stamped session logs for each conversation
   - Maintain session cache for in-progress work
   - Support explicit session continuation commands

4. **Structured Knowledge Management**
   - Organize information into logical tiers (Bootstrap, Critical, Essential, Reference)
   - Define clear file structure and naming conventions
   - Implement cross-referencing between related components

5. **Clear Command System**
   - Support explicit commands for reading and updating memory bank
   - Implement session management commands
   - Provide consistent command structure and documentation

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Core Memory Bank file structure and organization
- Session management system with time-stamped logs
- Progressive loading mechanism for efficient token usage
- Command system for explicit memory bank interaction
- Documentation of usage patterns and best practices

### Out of Scope

- Integration with specific AI frameworks or platforms
- Automated deployment or installation systems
- User interface components
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Version control beyond basic session logging

## Success Criteria

1. Successful continuation of work across multiple chat sessions
2. Minimal token usage through progressive loading
3. Comprehensive documentation of project knowledge
4. Clear and consistent command system
5. Robust session continuity mechanism
6. Demonstrable examples of effective Memory Bank usage

## Core Constraints

- The Memory Bank must operate exclusively within its designated directory
- All operations must use approved tools for file manipulation
- All actions must follow the step-by-step approval process
- Simplicity and clarity must be prioritized over complexity

## Target Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Core Structure** - Implement basic Memory Bank structure and files
2. **Phase 2: Session Management** - Develop time-stamped session logs and continuation
3. **Phase 3: Command System** - Refine and document the command system
4. **Phase 4: Documentation** - Create comprehensive usage guides and examples
5. **Phase 5: Testing & Refinement** - Test and optimize the system

## Stakeholders

- AI assistants using the Memory Bank system
- Users engaging in multi-session projects with AI assistants
- Developers extending or customizing the Memory Bank system
