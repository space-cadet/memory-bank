# Memory Bank Implementation Guidelines

*Created: 2025-04-08*  
*Last Updated: 2025-04-08*

## File Structure

1. All Memory Bank files must be Markdown (.md) format
2. File names should be camelCase except for special files (.cursorrules, bootstrap.md)
3. Each file must include creation and last updated timestamps
4. Session logs must use ISO datetime format (YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS.md)
5. All files should include clear section headings with ## heading level

## Content Guidelines

1. **All Memory Bank Files Must**:
   - Begin with a # title
   - Include timestamps for creation/updates
   - Use consistent heading structure
   - Include cross-references where appropriate
   - Follow markdown best practices

2. **Session Files Must**:
   - Use standardized timestamp format
   - Include session goals and status
   - Log progress chronologically
   - Document decisions made with rationale
   - List accomplishments and pending tasks

3. **Core Files Must**:
   - Maintain consistent structure across updates
   - Include cross-references to related files
   - Clearly identify current state and next actions
   - Use emoji indicators for status where appropriate (‚úÖüîÑ‚¨ú)

## Implementation Rules

1. **Progressive Loading**:
   - Always load bootstrap.md first
   - Check session_cache.md for continuity status
   - Load critical tier by default
   - Only load additional files when necessary

2. **Session Management**:
   - Create new time-stamped session log at start of each new session
   - Update session log throughout the conversation
   - Update session_cache.md when continuing or completing
   - Always link to most recent session log in session_cache.md

3. **Command Processing**:
   - Process all memory bank commands immediately
   - Follow exact command syntax as defined in bootstrap.md
   - Confirm command execution in responses
   - Default to minimal loading when no explicit command is given

4. **Updates**:
   - Use differential updates to minimize redundancy
   - Always update timestamps when modifying files
   - Ensure cross-references remain valid after updates
   - Maintain consistent formatting across updates

## Styling Conventions

1. **Status Indicators**:
   - ‚úÖ Complete/Working
   - üîÑ In Progress
   - ‚¨ú Not Started
   - ‚ùå Blocked/Issue

2. **Section Structure**:
   - Use ## for main sections
   - Use ### for subsections
   - Use #### for minor subdivisions
   - Use bullet lists for collections of related items
   - Use numbered lists for sequential steps or priorities

3. **Code and Command Formatting**:
   - Use backticks for inline commands: `read_mb`
   - Use code blocks for command examples or longer snippets
   - Use tables for command reference and parameters

4. **Cross-References**:
   - Use full paths for file references: [file.md](/path/to/file.md)
   - Use descriptive link text, not just filenames
   - Group related cross-references together

## Best Practices

1. Prioritize clarity and simplicity over complexity
2. Keep similar information grouped together
3. Update cross-references whenever file structure changes
4. Use consistent formatting across all files
5. Include "Last Updated" timestamps on all modified files
6. Regularly update progress.md with current status
7. Keep session logs focused on key decisions and progress
8. Use session_cache.md for short-term continuation only
