# Memory Bank Database

This folder is generated by `mb init` and contains:
- Parser scripts to build a SQLite database from your markdown Memory Bank
- A small web app (Viewer + Editor) to browse/manage the database

## Quick Start

From `memory-bank/database/`:

1) Install dependencies

pnpm install

2) Run all parsers (build/rebuild the DB)

./run-all.sh

This generates/updates `memory_bank.db`.

3) Start the viewer/editor

node server.js

Then open:
http://localhost:3000

## Notes

- `run-all.sh` runs `pnpm install`, `pnpm approve-builds`, and all parser scripts.
- The Viewer includes an Editor tab for DB selection/creation and importing `edit_history.md` into a chosen DB.
