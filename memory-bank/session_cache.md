## Active Tasks

### T1: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 14, 2025
**Last Active:** April 15, 2025 12:21 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Working on updating the Memory Bank system to support tracking multiple concurrent tasks. This involves creating a new task registry file, updating session_cache.md to handle multiple task contexts, updating the integrated rules, and creating templates for all memory bank files.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v4.md`: Updated integrated rules with multi-task support
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/tasks.md`: New task registry file
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/session_cache.md`: Updated to support multiple tasks
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/templates/`: New directory for file templates at project root

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Updated integrated rules to support multi-task workflow
2. âœ… Created tasks.md for task registry
3. âœ… Created templates directory
4. âœ… Created templates for all memory bank files
5. âœ… Updated session_cache.md to use multi-task structure
6. âœ… Updated other memory bank files with task references
7. âœ… Moved templates directory to project root

### T4: Optimize Integrated Rules for Token Efficiency
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 16, 2025
**Last Active:** April 16, 2025 11:41 UTC
**Dependencies:** T1

#### Context
Implementing a tiered, modular, and dynamically loaded Integrated Rules system to reduce token usage while maintaining context and usability. Created separate directory for development to avoid disrupting existing system.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/core/core-rules.md` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/core/manifest.json` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/modules/` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/loader.md` (created)

#### Implementation Progress
- âœ… Created folder structure for new modular rules system
- âœ… Created Core Rules module with essential instructions (~20% size)
- âœ… Developed module manifest system for tracking dependencies
- âœ… Created module loading mechanism
- âœ… Created transition documentation for migration
- âœ… Implementing module specifications
- â¬œ Develop Extended Rules modules for specific tasks
- â¬œ Test and validate token usage reduction and system functionality

#### Working State
Currently focusing on the foundation of the modular system with emphasis on token efficiency. Established separate development environment to avoid disrupting existing system. The core-rules.md file has been created with minimal essential instructions. Created module manifest system to track dependencies between modules. Developing gradually to validate the approach before full implementation.

#### Next Steps Recommendation
Rather than creating more files, we should:

1. **Evaluate the current core-rules.md** - Is it sufficiently minimal while providing essential functionality?
2. **Develop 1-2 sample modules** - Create just enough to demonstrate the module loading concept
3. **Test token efficiency** - Measure the token count of the core rules vs. the original integrated rules
4. **Refine the approach** - Based on token measurements and usability testing

By focusing on these aspects first, we can validate that the approach actually achieves the token efficiency goal before investing in detailed documentation and additional modules.
