## Active Tasks

### T1: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 14, 2025
**Last Active:** April 15, 2025 12:21 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Working on updating the Memory Bank system to support tracking multiple concurrent tasks. This involves creating a new task registry file, updating session_cache.md to handle multiple task contexts, updating the integrated rules, and creating templates for all memory bank files.

#### Critical Files
- `integrated-rules-v4.md`: Updated integrated rules with multi-task support
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`: New task registry file
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md`: Updated to support multiple tasks
- `templates/`: New directory for file templates at project root

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Updated integrated rules to support multi-task workflow
2. âœ… Created tasks.md for task registry
3. âœ… Created templates directory
4. âœ… Created templates for all memory bank files
5. âœ… Updated session_cache.md to use multi-task structure
6. âœ… Updated other memory bank files with task references
7. âœ… Moved templates directory to project root
8. ðŸ”„ Finalizing implementation and cleanup
9. â¬œ Test the new multi-task workflow

#### Working State
- Created integrated-rules-v4.md with multi-task support
- Created tasks.md with structure for tracking multiple tasks
- Created templates for all memory bank files
- Implementing task ID reference system across all files
- Updated session management workflows to preserve context when switching tasks

### T3: Implement Database Migration
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Dependencies:** T2 (Completed)
**Started:** April 15, 2025

#### Context
Implementing the database migration based on the recommended approach from task T2. Using Prisma ORM with a relational database to achieve efficient querying and reduced token usage through targeted data retrieval.

#### Critical Files
- Created:
  - `memory-bank/database/schema.prisma`: Schema definition for all database models
  - `memory-bank/database/.env`: Database configuration 
  - `memory-bank/database/package.json`: Node.js dependencies
  - `memory-bank/database/migration-scripts/convert.js`: Complete conversion script for markdown files
  - `memory-bank/database/migration-scripts/seed.js`: Script for seeding test data
- Reference files:
  - `memory-bank/database-planning/recommended_migration_plan.md`
  - `memory-bank/database-planning/database_planning.md`
  - `memory-bank/database-planning/database_migration.md`

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Created directory structure for database migration
2. âœ… Defined comprehensive Prisma schema based on both memory-bank and spin_network_app structures
3. âœ… Set up basic configuration files (.env, package.json)
4. âœ… Completed conversion scripts for markdown to database migration
5. âœ… Created seed script for testing database functionality
6. ðŸ”„ Set up Prisma environment and run initial migration
7. â¬œ Develop MCP server for database interaction (postponed for now)
8. â¬œ Integrate LLM workflow with new MCP server tools (postponed for now)

#### Design Decisions
- Multi-project support with Project model as the root entity
- Enhanced error logging with full text fields for detailed error information
- Support for custom project-specific documents through CustomDocument model
- Eliminated need for file rotation by leveraging database capabilities
- Added task relationship modeling with enhanced dependency types
- Using SQLite initially for development with option to migrate to PostgreSQL later
- Implemented robust markdown parsing to handle various file formats
- Added support for converting archived files and example projects

## Completed Tasks

### T2: Plan Database Migration Strategy
**Status:** âœ… DONE
**Completed:** April 15, 2025
**Related Files:**
- `memory-bank/database-planning/database_planning.md`
- `memory-bank/database-planning/database_migration.md`
- `memory-bank/database-planning/recommended_migration_plan.md`

## Session Notes
This session focused on implementing the database migration strategy (T3). We created a comprehensive Prisma schema that supports multiple projects and all required data structures from both memory-bank and spin_network_app projects. We determined that file rotation mechanisms aren't needed when using a database approach since databases handle large volumes of data efficiently. The next steps will be to complete the conversion scripts and set up the MCP server.
