# Session Cache

*Last Updated: April 10, 2025*

## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Enhancing the Memory Bank system with error logging and edit history tracking

## Current Step
Completed integration of error logging and edit history tracking into the integrated rules

## Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules.md` - Main rules document
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v2.md` - Updated rules with consistency fixes
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/edit_history.md` - New file for chronological edit tracking
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/errorLog.md` - New file for error tracking
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/session_cache.md` - This file for session continuity

## State Information
- Added error logging and edit history tracking to the integrated rules
- Enhanced session_cache template with Implementation Progress and Design Decisions sections
- Created examples for error logging and edit history tracking formats
- Resolved consistency issues between different sections of the integrated rules

## Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Examined example files from spin_network_app to understand needs
2. âœ… Identified missing functionality in current integrated rules
3. âœ… Created draft updates to integrate error logging and edit history
4. âœ… Identified and fixed consistency issues in the integrated rules
5. âœ… Created updated integrated-rules-v2.md with all improvements
6. âœ… Created edit_history.md to track file modifications
7. âœ… Created errorLog.md for error tracking
8. âœ… Updated session_cache.md with enhanced structure
9. ðŸ”„ Updating activeContext.md with current tasks
10. â¬œ Test the enhanced Memory Bank system with a practical task

## Design Decisions
- Placed errorLog.md and edit_history.md in the Critical Tier but with selective loading guidance
- Added specific commands for error logging and edit history tracking
- Enhanced workflow diagrams to explicitly include documentation update steps
- Added flexibility for batching edit history updates during rapid sequential edits
- Created comprehensive templates while allowing format flexibility
- Enhanced Documentation Decision Framework with new change types
- Added guidance for mixed change types and ongoing work documentation

## Notes
- The edit_history.md file should be updated after each file modification or at minimum every few chat messages
- The system now provides better support for debugging through structured error logging
- Session continuity is enhanced with more detailed Implementation Progress and Design Decisions sections
- The enhanced templates provide more structure while maintaining flexibility
- Next steps include creating a test scenario to validate the enhanced Memory Bank system
