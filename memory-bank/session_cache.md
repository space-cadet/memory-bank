## Active Tasks

### T1: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 14, 2025
**Last Active:** April 15, 2025 12:21 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Working on updating the Memory Bank system to support tracking multiple concurrent tasks. This involves creating a new task registry file, updating session_cache.md to handle multiple task contexts, updating the integrated rules, and creating templates for all memory bank files.

#### Critical Files
- `memory-bank/context-store/integrated-rules-v4.md`: Updated integrated rules with multi-task support
- `memory-bank/context-store/tasks.md`: New task registry file
- `memory-bank/context-store/session_cache.md`: Updated to support multiple tasks
- `templates/`: New directory for file templates at project root

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Updated integrated rules to support multi-task workflow
2. âœ… Created tasks.md for task registry
3. âœ… Created templates directory
4. âœ… Created templates for all memory bank files
5. âœ… Updated session_cache.md to use multi-task structure
6. âœ… Updated other memory bank files with task references
7. âœ… Moved templates directory to project root

### T4: Optimize Integrated Rules for Token Efficiency
**Status:** â¬œ NOT STARTED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** -
**Dependencies:** T1

#### Context
Implement a tiered, modular, and dynamically loaded Integrated Rules system to reduce token usage while maintaining context and usability.

#### Critical Files
- `memory-bank/core/core-rules.md`
- `memory-bank/modules/`
- `memory-bank/context-store/`
- `memory-bank/templates/`
- `memory-bank/loader.md`

#### Implementation Progress
- â¬œ Create Core Rules module with essential instructions (~20% size)
- â¬œ Develop Extended Rules modules for specific tasks (documentation, implementation, memory management, etc.)
- â¬œ Implement dynamic loading and unloading of rule modules during sessions
- â¬œ Restructure documentation flow to external templates and references
- â¬œ Optimize command structure with condensed descriptions and shorthand
- â¬œ Implement progressive disclosure for instructions
- â¬œ Update folder structure to support modular rules and context store
- â¬œ Test and validate token usage reduction and system functionality
