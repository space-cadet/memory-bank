# Session Cache

*Last Updated: April 13, 2025*

## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Examining project status and updating Memory Bank files

## Current Step
Completed examination of existing files and updating Memory Bank documentation

## Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/session_cache.md` - This file for session continuity
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/edit_history.md` - File for chronological edit tracking
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current task context
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/progress.md` - Implementation progress tracking

## State Information
- Examined current state of the Memory Bank files
- Updated session_cache.md with current session information
- Updated edit_history.md with recent file updates
- Updated activeContext.md with current tasks and focus
- Identified that the system now has errorLog.md and edit_history.md files established

## Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Examined project directory structure and key files
2. âœ… Reviewed memory-bank directory and its contents
3. âœ… Analyzed session_cache.md, edit_history.md, errorLog.md, activeContext.md, and progress.md
4. âœ… Updated session_cache.md with current session information
5. âœ… Updated edit_history.md with new file modifications
6. âœ… Updated activeContext.md with current tasks and focus
7. ðŸ”„ Continuing to monitor and update the Memory Bank as needed
8. â¬œ Prepare for next implementation phase if required

## Design Decisions
- Maintained the established file structure and organization
- Continued the chronological tracking in edit_history.md
- Kept the current task-oriented approach in session_cache.md and activeContext.md
- Preserved the existing format of the Memory Bank files
- Focused on updating only the necessary files based on current activity

## Notes
- The Memory Bank system appears to be functioning as designed
- The integration of error logging and edit history tracking has been completed
- The system is ready for testing with practical tasks
- The next steps should focus on validating the edit history tracking and error logging functionality
- Consider implementing the file size management protocol for edit_history.md and errorLog.md
