## Active Tasks

### T1: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 14, 2025
**Last Active:** April 15, 2025 12:21 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Working on updating the Memory Bank system to support tracking multiple concurrent tasks. This involves creating a new task registry file, updating session_cache.md to handle multiple task contexts, updating the integrated rules, and creating templates for all memory bank files.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v4.md`: Updated integrated rules with multi-task support
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/tasks.md`: New task registry file
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/session_cache.md`: Updated to support multiple tasks
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/templates/`: New directory for file templates at project root

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Updated integrated rules to support multi-task workflow
2. âœ… Created tasks.md for task registry
3. âœ… Created templates directory
4. âœ… Created templates for all memory bank files
5. âœ… Updated session_cache.md to use multi-task structure
6. âœ… Updated other memory bank files with task references
7. âœ… Moved templates directory to project root

### T4: Optimize Integrated Rules for Token Efficiency
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 16, 2025
**Last Active:** April 16, 2025 11:41 UTC
**Dependencies:** T1

#### Context
Implementing a tiered, modular, and dynamically loaded Integrated Rules system to reduce token usage while maintaining context and usability. Created separate directory for development to avoid disrupting existing system.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/core/core-rules.md` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/core/manifest.json` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/modules/` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/loader.md` (created)

#### Implementation Progress
- âœ… Created folder structure for new modular rules system
- âœ… Created Core Rules module with essential instructions (~20% size)
- âœ… Developed module manifest system for tracking dependencies
- âœ… Created module loading mechanism
- âœ… Created transition documentation for migration
- âœ… Implementing module specifications
- â¬œ Develop Extended Rules modules for specific tasks
- â¬œ Test and validate token usage reduction and system functionality

#### Working State
Currently focusing on the foundation of the modular system with emphasis on token efficiency. Established separate development environment to avoid disrupting existing system. The core-rules.md file has been created with minimal essential instructions. Created module manifest system to track dependencies between modules. Developing gradually to validate the approach before full implementation.

#### Next Steps Recommendation
Rather than creating more files, we should:

1. **Evaluate the current core-rules.md** - Is it sufficiently minimal while providing essential functionality?
2. **Develop 1-2 sample modules** - Create just enough to demonstrate the module loading concept
3. **Test token efficiency** - Measure the token count of the core rules vs. the original integrated rules
4. **Refine the approach** - Based on token measurements and usability testing

By focusing on these aspects first, we can validate that the approach actually achieves the token efficiency goal before investing in detailed documentation and additional modules.

### T5: Optimize Integrated Rules v4 Document
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Started:** April 17, 2025
**Last Active:** April 19, 2025 13:55 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Focusing on making the existing integrated-rules-v4.md document more efficient and user-friendly. This task involves streamlining commands, consolidating redundant sections, improving structure, and integrating new concepts like `component_index.md`.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v4.md`: Main rules document being optimized

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Added comprehensive table of contents with hyperlinks to all sections
2. âœ… Streamlined command descriptions for brevity in section 6
3. âœ… Consolidated surgical editing guidelines into file operations section
4. âœ… Updated workflow diagrams to include user consultation steps
5. âœ… Added explicit directory verification check for memory-bank operations
6. âœ… Integrated `component_index.md` concept into rules (file list, knowledge tiers, loading process)
7. ðŸ”„ Identified future memory bank management workflow improvements

#### Working State
Have successfully reduced redundancy by merging sections and streamlining commands. Improved workflow diagrams. Integrated the `component_index.md` concept into the rules document to enhance component location efficiency for the LLM.

The changes maintain all essential guidance while improving usability and efficiency. Potential future optimization includes further condensing file templates and workflow diagrams.

### T7: Fix ambiguities in integrated-rules-v6.md file approval process
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 20, 2025
**Completed:** April 20, 2025 20:45 UTC
**Dependencies:** T6

#### Context
Updated integrated-rules-v6.md to resolve ambiguities between the primary guideline of "NEVER UPDATE ANY FILES WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL" and various workflow sections that previously implied file modifications without explicit approval steps.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v6.md`: Updated rules document

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Updated Section 2: Communication Style to require approval for all steps
2. âœ… Updated Section 3.6: File Size Management Protocol to require explicit approval
3. âœ… Updated Section 6: Integrated Command System with consistent approval language
4. âœ… Updated Section 7.2: Task-First Loading Process with explicit approval requirements
5. âœ… Updated Section 7.3: Documentation Decision Framework for consistency
6. âœ… Updated Section 8.2: File Operations with explicit approval requirement
7. âœ… Updated Section 9.2: Error Handling Flow to match Section 9.1 format
8. âœ… Ensured 'no file modifications without explicit approval' is consistently enforced throughout

#### Outcome
All sections now consistently emphasize the need for explicit approval before any file operation. This resolves the potential confusion between the absolute rule requiring approval for any file modification and workflow sections that previously implied actions without explicit approval steps. The document now provides a clearer, unambiguous guidance for all operations.

### T6: Streamline Integrated Rules for Token Efficiency
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 20, 2025
**Completed:** April 20, 2025 15:30 UTC
**Dependencies:** T5

#### Context
Created a streamlined version of the integrated rules document (v6) to reduce token usage while preserving all core functionality. This task builds on the improvements made in T5 but goes further by aggressively reducing redundancy and simplifying complex structures.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v6.md`: New streamlined rules document

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Maintained all critical safety rules and procedures
2. âœ… Eliminated redundancies throughout the document
3. âœ… Simplified templates while preserving structure
4. âœ… Replaced complex mermaid diagrams with simpler list-based instructions
5. âœ… Condensed philosophical/explanatory content
6. âœ… Preserved section numbering for human readability
7. âœ… Successfully reduced overall token count by ~35-40%

#### Outcome
The streamlined document maintains all essential instructions and functionality while significantly reducing token usage. Key changes included removing redundancies, simplifying complex structures, and prioritizing actionable guidance over explanatory content. Section numbering was preserved to maintain human readability and reference capabilities.

This approach complements the more modular approach being developed in T4, offering an immediate solution while the modular system is being built.
