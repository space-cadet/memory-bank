## Active Tasks

### T1: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 14, 2025
**Last Active:** April 15, 2025 12:21 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Working on updating the Memory Bank system to support tracking multiple concurrent tasks. This involves creating a new task registry file, updating session_cache.md to handle multiple task contexts, updating the integrated rules, and creating templates for all memory bank files.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v4.md`: Updated integrated rules with multi-task support
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/tasks.md`: New task registry file
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/session_cache.md`: Updated to support multiple tasks
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/templates/`: New directory for file templates at project root

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Updated integrated rules to support multi-task workflow
2. âœ… Created tasks.md for task registry
3. âœ… Created templates directory
4. âœ… Created templates for all memory bank files
5. âœ… Updated session_cache.md to use multi-task structure
6. âœ… Updated other memory bank files with task references
7. âœ… Moved templates directory to project root

### T4: Optimize Integrated Rules for Token Efficiency
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 16, 2025
**Last Active:** April 16, 2025 11:41 UTC
**Dependencies:** T1

#### Context
Implementing a tiered, modular, and dynamically loaded Integrated Rules system to reduce token usage while maintaining context and usability. Created separate directory for development to avoid disrupting existing system.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/core/core-rules.md` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/core/manifest.json` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/modules/` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/loader.md` (created)

#### Implementation Progress
- âœ… Created folder structure for new modular rules system
- âœ… Created Core Rules module with essential instructions (~20% size)
- âœ… Developed module manifest system for tracking dependencies
- âœ… Created module loading mechanism
- âœ… Created transition documentation for migration
- âœ… Implementing module specifications
- â¬œ Develop Extended Rules modules for specific tasks
- â¬œ Test and validate token usage reduction and system functionality

#### Working State
Currently focusing on the foundation of the modular system with emphasis on token efficiency. Established separate development environment to avoid disrupting existing system. The core-rules.md file has been created with minimal essential instructions. Created module manifest system to track dependencies between modules. Developing gradually to validate the approach before full implementation.

#### Next Steps Recommendation
Rather than creating more files, we should:

1. **Evaluate the current core-rules.md** - Is it sufficiently minimal while providing essential functionality?
2. **Develop 1-2 sample modules** - Create just enough to demonstrate the module loading concept
3. **Test token efficiency** - Measure the token count of the core rules vs. the original integrated rules
4. **Refine the approach** - Based on token measurements and usability testing

By focusing on these aspects first, we can validate that the approach actually achieves the token efficiency goal before investing in detailed documentation and additional modules.

### T5: Optimize Integrated Rules v4 Document
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Started:** April 17, 2025
**Last Active:** April 17, 2025 17:15 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Focusing on making the existing integrated-rules-v4.md document more efficient and user-friendly while T4 works on the longer-term modular approach. This task involves streamlining commands, consolidating redundant sections, and improving the overall document structure.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v4.md`: Main rules document being optimized

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Added comprehensive table of contents with hyperlinks to all sections
2. âœ… Streamlined command descriptions for brevity in section 6
3. âœ… Consolidated surgical editing guidelines into file operations section
4. âœ… Updated workflow diagrams to include user consultation steps
5. âœ… Added explicit directory verification check for memory-bank operations
6. ðŸ”„ Identified future memory bank management workflow improvements

#### Working State
Have successfully reduced redundancy by merging section 4.3 (Surgical File Editing Guidelines) into section 8.2 (File Operations). Also improved the workflow diagrams to better reflect actual usage patterns, adding explicit check-points where user confirmation should be requested. Command sections have been streamlined to reduce token usage while maintaining clarity. 

The changes maintain all essential guidance while reducing overall document size. Potential future optimization includes further condensing file templates and workflow diagrams, but these have been deferred as they don't significantly impact token usage.
