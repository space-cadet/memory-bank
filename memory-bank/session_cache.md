## Active Tasks

### T2: Optimize Rules System for Token Efficiency
**Status:** â¬œ NOT STARTED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** -
**Last Active:** April 15, 2025 (planning phase)
**Dependencies:** T1

#### Context
Planning to optimize the rules system to reduce token usage by creating a modular structure with a small core set of rules and specialized modules that can be loaded on demand. This will involve restructuring the folder organization and creating a new streamlined core-rules.md file.

#### Critical Files
- Future: `core/core-rules.md`
- Future: `modules/` specialized rule files
- Future: `context-store/` (replacement for memory-bank folder)
- Future: `loader.md`

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Created optimization plan
2. â¬œ Create folder structure
3. â¬œ Create core-rules.md with essential instructions
4. â¬œ Create specialized module files
5. â¬œ Implement dynamic loading mechanism
6. â¬œ Move examples to separate files
7. â¬œ Test token efficiency gains

#### Working State
- Created plan for optimizing rules system
- Proposed new folder structure
- Added task to tracking system

### T1: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 14, 2025
**Last Active:** April 14, 2025 16:00 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Working on updating the Memory Bank system to support tracking multiple concurrent tasks. This involves creating a new task registry file, updating session_cache.md to handle multiple task contexts, updating the integrated rules, and creating templates for all memory bank files.

#### Critical Files
- `integrated-rules-v4.md`: Updated integrated rules with multi-task support
- `memory-bank/tasks.md`: New task registry file
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md`: Updated to support multiple tasks
- `templates/`: New directory for file templates at project root

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Updated integrated rules to support multi-task workflow
2. âœ… Created tasks.md for task registry
3. âœ… Created templates directory
4. âœ… Created templates for all memory bank files
5. âœ… Updated session_cache.md to use multi-task structure
6. âœ… Updated other memory bank files with task references
7. âœ… Moved templates directory to project root
8. ðŸ”„ Finalizing implementation and cleanup
9. â¬œ Test the new multi-task workflow

#### Working State
- Created integrated-rules-v4.md with multi-task support
- Created tasks.md with structure for tracking multiple tasks
- Created templates for all memory bank files
- Implementing task ID reference system across all files
- Updated session management workflows to preserve context when switching tasks

## Session Notes
This session includes planning for token optimization of the rules system (T2) while continuing work on multi-task support (T1). The optimization plan includes creating a modular structure with a small core set of rules and specialized modules that can be loaded on demand. This will significantly reduce the token usage for each interaction with the LLM while maintaining the system's effectiveness.
