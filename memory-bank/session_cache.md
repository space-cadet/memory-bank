## Active Tasks

### T1: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 14, 2025
**Last Active:** April 15, 2025 12:21 UTC
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Working on updating the Memory Bank system to support tracking multiple concurrent tasks. This involves creating a new task registry file, updating session_cache.md to handle multiple task contexts, updating the integrated rules, and creating templates for all memory bank files.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v4.md`: Updated integrated rules with multi-task support
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/tasks.md`: New task registry file
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/session_cache.md`: Updated to support multiple tasks
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/templates/`: New directory for file templates at project root

#### Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Updated integrated rules to support multi-task workflow
2. âœ… Created tasks.md for task registry
3. âœ… Created templates directory
4. âœ… Created templates for all memory bank files
5. âœ… Updated session_cache.md to use multi-task structure
6. âœ… Updated other memory bank files with task references
7. âœ… Moved templates directory to project root

### T4: Optimize Integrated Rules for Token Efficiency
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 16, 2025
**Last Active:** April 16, 2025 00:15 UTC
**Dependencies:** T1

#### Context
Implementing a tiered, modular, and dynamically loaded Integrated Rules system to reduce token usage while maintaining context and usability. Created separate directory for development to avoid disrupting existing system.

#### Critical Files
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/core/core-rules.md` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/core/manifest.json` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/modules/` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/` (created)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/optimized-rules/loader.md` (created)

#### Implementation Progress
- âœ… Created folder structure for new modular rules system
- âœ… Created Core Rules module with essential instructions (~20% size)
- âœ… Developed module manifest system for tracking dependencies
- âœ… Created module loading mechanism
- âœ… Created transition documentation for migration
- ðŸ”„ Implementing module specifications
- â¬œ Develop Extended Rules modules for specific tasks
- â¬œ Test and validate token usage reduction and system functionality

#### Working State
Currently focusing on the foundation of the modular system with emphasis on token efficiency. Established separate development environment to avoid disrupting existing system. The core-rules.md file has been created with minimal essential instructions. Created module manifest system to track dependencies between modules. Developing gradually to validate the approach before full implementation.
