**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Dependencies:** T2 (Completed)

#### Completed Steps
- âœ… Created directory structure for database migration
- âœ… Defined comprehensive Prisma schema based on both memory-bank and spin_network_app structures
- âœ… Set up basic configuration files (.env, package.json)
- âœ… Started developing conversion scripts for markdown to database migration

#### Current Work
- ðŸ”„ Developing conversion scripts for markdown to database migration

#### Up Next
- â¬œ Complete conversion scripts implementation
- â¬œ Set up Prisma environment and run initial migration
- â¬œ Develop MCP server for database interaction
- â¬œ Integrate LLM workflow with new MCP server tools
- â¬œ Test migration process and data integrity

## Completed Tasks

### T2: Plan Database Migration Strategy
**Completed:** April 15, 2025
**Summary:** Analyzed requirements and proposed strategies for migrating Memory Bank data from Markdown files to a database system. Compared different approaches including enhanced Markdown, MongoDB, and SQL with Prisma ORM. Recommended using Prisma ORM with a relational database for efficient querying and reduced token usage through targeted data retrieval.

### T0: Initial Memory Bank setup
**Completed:** April 10, 2025
**Summary:** Set up the initial Memory Bank system with core files, integrated rules, and documentation structure. Added error logging and edit history tracking. Enhanced session cache template with improved structure.

## Upcoming Work
- [ ] Complete database migration implementation
- [ ] Build MCP server for database interactions
- [ ] Test token usage with database queries vs. file operations
- [ ] Validate data integrity after migration
- [ ] Implement LLM integration with database via MCP server
- [ ] Optimize database query patterns for efficient token usage
- [ ] Create comprehensive examples directory
