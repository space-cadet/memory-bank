- ✅ Added four-tier loading framework (Bootstrap, Critical, Essential, Reference)
- ✅ Expanded Section 6.5 with 8-step Memory Bank Update Workflow
- ✅ Documented commit message format (conventional commits)

**Next**: File Update Trigger Matrix, Session Cache Protocol details

### T13: Implement Memory Bank CLI
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (85% Complete)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** 2025-05-17

- ✅ Timezone-agnostic initialization
- ✅ Database template inclusion
- ✅ Migration script support
- ⬜ mb task command (create, list, show, update)
- ⬜ mb session command (start, complete)
- ⬜ mb template command (list, use)

**Note**: Core initialization system operational and production-ready.

### T3: Implement Database Migration
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (95% Complete)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** 2025-04-15

**Completion Status (2025-11-11)**:
- ✅ Schema creation and environment setup
