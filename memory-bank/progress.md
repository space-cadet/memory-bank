**Priority:** HIGH

#### Completed Steps
- âœ… Updated integrated rules to support multi-task workflow
- âœ… Created tasks.md for task registry
- âœ… Created templates directory
- âœ… Created templates for all memory bank files
- âœ… Updated session_cache.md to use multi-task structure
- âœ… Updated edit_history.md with task ID references
- âœ… Updated activeContext.md with multi-task structure

#### Current Work
- ðŸ”„ Updating progress.md to use task-based organization

#### Up Next
- â¬œ Test the task switching workflow
- â¬œ Update other Memory Bank files as needed
- â¬œ Implement file size management for task registry

### T3: Implement Database Migration
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Dependencies:** T2 (Completed)

#### Completed Steps
- âœ… Created directory structure for database migration
- âœ… Defined comprehensive Prisma schema based on both memory-bank and spin_network_app structures
- âœ… Set up basic configuration files (.env, package.json)
- âœ… Completed conversion scripts for markdown to database migration
- âœ… Created seed script for testing database functionality
- âœ… Fixed SQLite compatibility issues in schema (removed @db.Text annotations)
- âœ… Enhanced date parsing in conversion script to handle edge cases
- âœ… Created comprehensive migration guide

#### Current Work
- ðŸ”„ Testing migration results and validating database functionality

#### Up Next
- â¬œ Implement database backup/restore mechanisms
- â¬œ Develop MCP server for database interaction (postponed for now)

- âœ… Created manifest.json for module tracking and dependency management
- âœ… Developed module loading mechanism in loader.md
- âœ… Created basic command reference and quickstart guide
- âœ… Established transition strategy with compatibility documentation

#### Current Work
- ðŸ”„ Developing module specifications and structure

#### Up Next
- â¬œ Create 1-2 sample modules to demonstrate the concept
- â¬œ Measure token efficiency of core rules vs. original integrated rules
- â¬œ Refine approach based on measurements
- â¬œ Develop remaining rule modules
- â¬œ Implement dynamic loading/unloading functionality
- â¬œ Test with various scenarios to validate approach

## Completed Tasks

### T2: Plan Database Migration Strategy
**Completed:** April 15, 2025
**Summary:** Analyzed requirements and proposed strategies for migrating Memory Bank data from Markdown files to a database system. Compared different approaches including enhanced Markdown, MongoDB, and SQL with Prisma ORM. Recommended using Prisma ORM with a relational database for efficient querying and reduced token usage through targeted data retrieval.

### T0: Initial Memory Bank setup
**Completed:** April 10, 2025
**Summary:** Set up the initial Memory Bank system with core files, integrated rules, and documentation structure. Added error logging and edit history tracking. Enhanced session cache template with improved structure.
