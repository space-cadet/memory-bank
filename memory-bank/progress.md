### T3: Implement Database Migration
**Status:** ⬜ PLANNED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Dependencies:** T2 (Completed)

#### Up Next

- ⬜ Integrate LLM workflow with new MCP tools

## Completed Tasks

### T2: Plan Database Migration Strategy
**Completed:** April 15, 2025
**Summary:** Analyzed requirements and proposed strategies for migrating Memory Bank data from Markdown files to a database system. Compared different approaches including enhanced Markdown, MongoDB, and SQL with Prisma ORM. Recommended using Prisma ORM with a relational database for efficient querying and reduced token usage through targeted data retrieval.

### T0: Initial Memory Bank setup
**Completed:** April 10, 2025
**Summary:** Set up the initial Memory Bank system with core files, integrated rules, and documentation structure. Added error logging and edit history tracking. Enhanced session cache template with improved structure.
