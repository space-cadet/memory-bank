   - Status: âœ… COMPLETED (April 15, 2025)
   - Output: Created database planning documents

## Implementation Focus

## Current Decisions
1. Using task IDs (T1, T2, T3, etc.) for cross-referencing across all Memory Bank files
2. Maintaining separate sections for active and completed tasks in session_cache.md
3. Using emoji status indicators (ðŸ”„, âœ…, â¬œ) for clear visual tracking
4. Selected Prisma ORM with relational database for memory bank migration (outcome of T2)
5. Multi-project design to support both memory-bank and spin_network_app
6. No need for file rotation mechanisms when using database approach

## Next Actions
1. Complete the remaining Node.js setup for the database environment
2. Finish development of conversion scripts for all markdown files
3. Run initial Prisma migration to create database tables
4. Develop MCP server with API endpoints for LLM integration
5. Test data migration and querying
