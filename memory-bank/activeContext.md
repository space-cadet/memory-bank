# Active Context

*Last Updated: April 13, 2025*

## Current Tasks
- Examining project status and updating Memory Bank files ðŸ”„
- Testing the enhanced Memory Bank system with practical tasks â¬œ
- Implementing the file size management protocol for edit_history.md and errorLog.md â¬œ
- Validating edit history tracking and error logging functionality â¬œ

## Implementation Focus
- Memory Bank file maintenance and updates
- Session continuity through accurate documentation
- Preparing for testing the enhanced system features
- Ensuring documentation currency and accuracy

## Current Decisions
- Only update files that need changes based on current activity
- Maintain existing file formats and structures for consistency
- Focus on preparing the system for practical testing
- Consider implementing the file size management protocol as described in the integrated rules

- **Updated Rules**: [integrated-rules-v2.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v2.md)
- **Edit History**: [edit_history.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/edit_history.md)
- **Error Log**: [errorLog.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/errorLog.md)
- **Session Cache**: [session_cache.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/session_cache.md)
- **Progress**: [progress.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/progress.md)

## Current Considerations
- Need to validate the system with practical implementation tasks
- Need to test the error logging functionality with actual error scenarios
- Need to verify the effectiveness of the file size management protocol
- Need to ensure all documentation remains consistent and up-to-date

## Next Actions
1. Complete the examination of project status and Memory Bank updates
2. Set up a test scenario to validate the enhanced Memory Bank system
3. Create a sample error scenario to test the error logging functionality
4. Implement and test the file size management protocol
5. Verify the edit history tracking across multiple file modifications
6. Update progress.md to reflect current status after testing
7. Ensure all Memory Bank files remain synchronized and consistent
