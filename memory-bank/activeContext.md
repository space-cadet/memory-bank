*Last Updated: April 10, 2025*

## Current Tasks
- Enhancing Memory Bank system with error logging and edit history tracking âœ…
- Ensuring consistency across integrated rules documentation ðŸ”„
- Implementing comprehensive documentation for system components ðŸ”„

## Implementation Focus
- Error logging and tracking component integration
- File modification history tracking
- Enhanced session continuity mechanisms
- Improved documentation templates

## Current Decisions
- Added errorLog.md and edit_history.md to Critical Tier with selective loading guidance
- Enhanced session_cache.md template to include Implementation Progress and Design Decisions
- Added documentation guidance for batching edit history updates during rapid sequential edits
- Expanded Documentation Decision Framework to include new change types
- Added flexibility to documentation templates while maintaining structure

## Cross-References
- **Integrated Rules**: [integrated-rules.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules.md)
- **Updated Rules**: [integrated-rules-v2.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v2.md)
- **Edit History**: [edit_history.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/edit_history.md)
- **Error Log**: [errorLog.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/errorLog.md)
- **Session Cache**: [session_cache.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/session_cache.md)

## Current Considerations
- Need to balance frequent documentation updates with implementation efficiency
- Need to ensure selective loading of error logs and edit history for relevant tasks
- Need to maintain both structured and flexible documentation templates

## Next Actions
1. Test the enhanced Memory Bank system with a practical task
2. Implement error tracking with a sample error scenario
3. Validate edit history tracking across multiple file modifications
4. Review integrated rules for any remaining inconsistencies
5. Create documentation for best practices in using the enhanced system
6. Update progress.md to reflect the enhanced system capabilities
