# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Primary Task:** T1
**Secondary Tasks:** -

## Active Tasks
- [T1]: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support - Updating Memory Bank files with multi-task structure

## Implementation Focus
- Implementing multi-task support for Memory Bank system
- Creating task registry and task ID reference system
- Updating session cache and other documents to support multiple concurrent tasks
- Creating templates for all Memory Bank files

## Task-Specific Context

### Task T1
Working on enhancing the Memory Bank system to support multiple concurrent tasks. This includes:
- Creating a task registry system with unique task IDs
- Updating session_cache.md to maintain context for multiple tasks
- Updating documentation templates to include task references
- Updating workflows to support task switching without losing context
- Creating a templates directory with standardized formats for all Memory Bank files

## Current Decisions
- Task IDs follow a simple sequential format (T1, T2, etc.)
- Tasks can be in one of four states: IN PROGRESS, PAUSED, COMPLETED, NOT STARTED
- All documentation updates require task ID references
- Each task maintains its own context in session_cache.md
- Templates standardize the format for all Memory Bank files

## Next Actions By Task
- [T1]: 
  1. Update progress.md to use multi-task structure
  2. Test the task switching workflow
  3. Complete multi-task support implementation
  4. Update other Memory Bank files as needed
