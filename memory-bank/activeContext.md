## Current Tasks
1. **[T1]**: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support (HIGH priority)
   - Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (80% complete)
   - Next Steps: Finalize implementation and cleanup

2. **[T3]**: Implement Database Migration (IN PROGRESS)
   - Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (75% complete)
   - Prerequisites: Complete planning (T2) âœ…
   - Current Focus: Fixed SQLite compatibility issues and enhanced date parsing

## Completed Tasks
1. **[T2]**: Plan Database Migration Strategy
   - Status: âœ… COMPLETED (April 15, 2025)
   - Output: Created database planning documents

## Implementation Focus
- Fixed SQLite compatibility issues in Prisma schema
- Enhanced date parsing functionality in conversion scripts
- Creating comprehensive migration guide and documentation
- Testing conversion results and database functionality
- Addressing error handling and data validation in migration process
- Verifying data integrity after migration
- Preparing for MCP server implementation (postponed until database testing complete)

## Current Decisions
1. Using task IDs (T1, T2, T3, etc.) for cross-referencing across all Memory Bank files
2. Maintaining separate sections for active and completed tasks in session_cache.md
3. Using emoji status indicators (ðŸ”„, âœ…, â¬œ) for clear visual tracking
4. Selected Prisma ORM with relational database for memory bank migration (outcome of T2)
5. Multi-project design to support both memory-bank and spin_network_app
6. No need for file rotation mechanisms when using database approach
7. Removed all `@db.Text` annotations from Prisma schema for SQLite compatibility
8. Enhanced date validation with fallback to current date for invalid dates
9. Postponing MCP server implementation until after database migration testing
10. Added support for handling archived files and example projects in conversion scripts

## Next Actions
1. Continue testing the database migration results
2. Perform more extensive validation of the converted data
3. Consider creating database backup/restore mechanisms
4. Document database querying patterns for common use cases
5. Test multi-project support and example project conversion
6. Update remaining memory bank files with database functionality information
7. Create sample queries for common database operations
