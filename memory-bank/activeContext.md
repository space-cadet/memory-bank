# Active Context

*Last Updated: April 15, 2025*

## Current Tasks
1. **[T1]**: Update Memory Bank with multi-task support (HIGH priority)
   - Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (80% complete)
   - Next Steps: Finalize implementation and cleanup

2. **[T3]**: Implement Database Migration (IN PROGRESS)
   - Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (60% complete)
   - Prerequisites: Complete planning (T2) âœ…
   - Current Focus: Testing conversion scripts and database migration

## Completed Tasks
1. **[T2]**: Plan Database Migration Strategy
   - Status: âœ… COMPLETED (April 15, 2025)
   - Output: Created database planning documents

## Implementation Focus
- Implementing database migration with Prisma ORM and SQLite
- Testing conversion scripts for markdown-to-database migration
- Verifying data integrity after migration
- Planning testing approach to validate database functionality
- Preparing for MCP server implementation (postponed until database testing complete)

## Current Decisions
1. Using task IDs (T1, T2, T3, etc.) for cross-referencing across all Memory Bank files
2. Maintaining separate sections for active and completed tasks in session_cache.md
3. Using emoji status indicators (ðŸ”„, âœ…, â¬œ) for clear visual tracking
4. Selected Prisma ORM with relational database for memory bank migration (outcome of T2)
5. Multi-project design to support both memory-bank and spin_network_app
6. No need for file rotation mechanisms when using database approach
7. Postponing MCP server implementation until after database migration testing
8. Added support for handling archived files and example projects in conversion scripts

## Next Actions
1. Run initial Prisma migration to create database tables
2. Execute the conversion script to migrate existing markdown files
3. Verify data integrity in the migrated database using Prisma Studio
4. Test querying capabilities with sample database requests
5. Validate multi-project support and example project conversion
6. Document database schema and migration process
