# Active Context

*Last Updated: April 8, 2025*

## Current Focus
Integration of the Memory Bank system with Code Rules to create a unified approach for task execution and project knowledge management.

## System State
- Integrated Code Rules with Memory Bank system
- Implemented comprehensive XML tag format for tool operations
- Created detailed documentation standards
- Defined task-first implementation flow
- Established session management workflow

## Recent Changes
- Created integrated-rules.md file combining Code Rules and Memory Bank
- Expanded command system to include task execution and code implementation
- Added workflow diagrams for implementation and session management
- Implemented Documentation Decision Framework
- Added MCP server integration specifications

## Active Decisions
- Taking a task-first approach that prioritizes immediate execution with minimal context
- Using a tiered documentation approach (Bootstrap → Critical → Essential → Reference)
- Implementing progressive loading to optimize token usage
- Using time-stamped session logs with session_cache.md for continuity

## Cross-References
- **Integrated Rules**: [integrated-rules.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules.md)
- **Project Brief**: [projectbrief.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/projectbrief.md)
- **System Patterns**: [systemPatterns.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md)
- **Technical Context**: [techContext.md](/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/techContext.md)

## Current Considerations
- Need to test token usage under various loading scenarios
- Need to optimize for complex multi-session workflows
- Need to develop comprehensive examples for different use cases

## Next Actions
1. Test session continuation across multiple sessions
2. Create comprehensive examples for different scenarios
3. Optimize token usage for different loading patterns
4. Develop detailed guides for complex workflows
5. Test system with real-world project structures
