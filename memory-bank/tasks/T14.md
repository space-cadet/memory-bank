# T14: Project-Specific Rule Adaptations
*Last Updated: 2025-05-23*

**Description**: Create adaptations of the integrated memory bank rules for different project types, starting with physics research papers. This involves modifying terminology, file structures, task examples, and workflows to be appropriate for non-software development projects while maintaining the core memory bank system principles.

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Create research-adapted rules (integrated-rules-research-v1.md) for physics/LaTeX projects
- [ ] Test research rules with a sample physics project
- [ ] Create additional adaptations for other project types (creative writing, business projects, etc.)
- [ ] Document the adaptation process and guidelines
- [ ] Create templates for project-type-specific adaptations

- `integrated-rules-v6.4.md` - Original software development rules
- `templates/` - Future project-type templates

## Progress
1. âœ… Analyzed current rules for software-development bias
2. âœ… Created physics research adaptation (integrated-rules-research-v1.md)
3. âœ… Added research-specific files (bibTracker.md, litReview.md)
4. âœ… Updated task examples to research context
5. ðŸ”„ Document adaptation methodology
6. â¬œ Test with sample physics project
7. â¬œ Create adaptation guidelines
8. â¬œ Plan additional project type adaptations

## Context
The original integrated rules were heavily biased toward software development projects with terminology like "implementation", "code standards", "GitHub integration", etc. Many projects (research papers, creative writing, business planning) need similar memory bank organization but with domain-appropriate terminology and workflows.

**Key Changes Made for Physics Research:**
- Kept core file structure but adapted content
- Added `bibTracker.md` for citation management
- Added `litReview.md` for research content analysis
- Updated task examples (derive equations, write sections, literature review)
- Maintained GitHub integration (universally applicable)
- Kept code implementation commands (research often includes analysis code)

**Future Project Types to Consider:**
- Creative writing projects (novels, screenplays)
- Business planning projects
- Educational content development
- Art/design projects
- Engineering projects

## Notes
This represents a new direction for the memory bank system - making it truly universal across project types rather than software-development specific. The core organizational principles remain the same, but terminology and examples adapt to the domain.
