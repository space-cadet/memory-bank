# T13: Implement Memory Bank CLI
*Last Updated: May 17, 2025*

**Description**: Design and implement a Command Line Interface (CLI) for Memory Bank to replace the current manual copy-paste workflow. The CLI will provide standardized commands for managing tasks, sessions, and project structure, making the system more user-friendly and reducing potential errors.

**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: May 17, 2025
**Last Active**: May 18, 2025
**Dependencies**: T12 (Documentation needs to be updated once CLI is implemented)

## Completion Criteria
- CLI provides all core Memory Bank functionality:
  - Project initialization (`mb init`)
  - Task management (`mb task`)
  - Session management (`mb session`)
  - File operations (`mb file`)
  - Memory Bank updates (`mb update`)
- Automated template creation and management
- Interactive mode for complex operations
- Proper error handling and validation
- Built-in help system
- Shell completion support
- Configuration management

11. â¬œ Create distribution package
12. â¬œ Update system documentation for CLI

## Context
The current Memory Bank system relies on manual file creation and copy-paste operations, which can be error-prone and time-consuming. A CLI will standardize these operations, making the system more accessible and reliable. Key features needed:

### Command Structure
```bash
mb init                          # Initialize new project
mb task create "Task name"      # Create new task
mb task list                    # List all tasks
mb task show T13               # Show task details
mb task update T13 --status="in-progress"  # Update task
mb session start               # Start new session
mb session cache              # Cache current session
mb session complete          # Complete current session
```

### Template Management
- Automated creation of task files
- Session file management
- Project structure initialization
- Configuration file handling

### Interactive Mode
- Guided project setup
- Task creation wizard
- Session management prompts
- Configuration assistance

### Configuration
- Project-specific settings
- User preferences
- GitHub integration settings
- Custom template locations
- Default values

### Key Requirements
1. Must maintain current system's flexibility
2. Should follow KIRSS principle
3. Must handle all current file operations
4. Should provide validation and error checking
5. Must be backward compatible with existing projects
6. Should support both interactive and command modes

### Implementation Notes
- Use a modern CLI framework (e.g., Commander.js, Yargs)
- Follow Unix CLI conventions
- Provide clear, helpful error messages
- Include progress indicators for long operations
- Support both novice and expert users
- Maintain idempotency where possible
