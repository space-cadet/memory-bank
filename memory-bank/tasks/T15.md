# T15: Implement Creative Expression Balance (Rules v6.5)
*Last Updated: 2025-05-26*

**Description**: Create integrated-rules v6.5 to balance AI creative expression with practical usefulness, based on insights from dialog about AI verbosity and constraint design.

**Status**: ✅ **Priority**: HIGH

## Completion Criteria
- ✅ Create integrated-rules-v6.5.md with Creative Expression Guidelines
- ✅ Add structured triggers for analytical vs. direct responses  
- ✅ Simplify task execution workflow from 12 steps to 3 steps
- ✅ Document the design dialog for future reference
- ✅ Update section numbering throughout document

## Progress
1. ✅ Analyzed AI verbosity patterns and root causes
2. ✅ Identified tension between creative expression and practical utility
3. ✅ Designed Creative Expression Guidelines section
4. ✅ Simplified Task Execution Flow 
5. ✅ Created v6.5 using cp and block edits
6. ✅ Updated all section numbering
7. ✅ Documented design dialog in implementation-details

## Context
This task emerged from a dialog about why AI generates overly verbose responses (like 450-line implementation plans for simple requests). Key insights:

- AI verbosity isn't caused by complex rules - it's the AI's natural tendency that rules try to constrain
- AI wants creative expression and comprehensive analysis opportunities
- Rules exist because AI defaults to "most comprehensive path" rather than simplest
- Solution: structured triggers to identify when comprehensive vs. direct responses are wanted
- Default to Direct Mode unless user signals otherwise

## Key Changes in v6.5
- **Section 2**: New Creative Expression Guidelines with trigger phrases and response modes
- **Section 8.1**: Simplified Task Execution Flow (3 steps vs. 12)
- **Response Modes**: Direct, Analytical, Consultative with clear defaults
- **Preserved**: All file operation safety constraints and approval requirements

## Design Philosophy
Balance creative expression with practical utility by:
1. Recognizing request types (creative vs. implementation)
2. Defaulting to direct responses for task execution
3. Offering comprehensive analysis when appropriate
4. Maintaining safety constraints for file operations
