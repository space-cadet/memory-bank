# T22: AdminJS Database Management Interface

*Created: 2025-11-22 16:50:00 IST*
*Status: ❌ Cancelled*
*Priority: HIGH*

**Description**: Implement a standardized AdminJS dashboard to provide a robust CRUD interface for the Memory Bank database. This tool bridges the gap between the database schema (T21) and the need for a management UI (T19/Phase B), enabling "Phase B: Insert Functions" via auto-generated forms without custom frontend code.

**Dependencies**: T21 (Database Schema)
**Successor To**: T19 (For management/write use cases)

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Infrastructure: Create `t21-workflow-testing/admin-poc` workspace (Failed due to complexity)
- [ ] Dependencies: Install AdminJS, Express, Objection.js, Knex
- [ ] Database Layer: Implement Objection.js Models for all 8 core tables
- [ ] Server: Implement `server.js` with AdminJS middleware
- [ ] Verification: Confirm Read/Write access to `test_memory_bank.db`
- [ ] Documentation: Update usage guide

## Progress
- **Planning**: Completed (See `adminjs-viewer-plan.md`)
- **POC Attempt**: 2025-11-22. Encountered significant friction with tooling (NPM vs PNPM), version conflicts (AdminJS v7 vs v6), and module systems (ESM vs CommonJS).
- **Decision**: Abandoned T22 in favor of refactoring T19 (Viewer) to support writes. The complexity of introducing AdminJS outweighed the benefits for this internal tool.

## Context
Originally, T21 (Database Workflow) required implementing custom "Insert Functions" and T19 (Viewer) was building a custom "Explorer". T22 was attempting to replace manual UI code with AdminJS. However, the implementation proved too brittle. We will revert to T19 and extend it manually.
