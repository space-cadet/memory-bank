# T10: Clarify Directory Structure in Rules v6.3
*Last Updated: 2025-05-17*

**Description**: Add explicit specifications to v6.3 rules to clarify the relationship and distinction between project root directory and memory bank system location. This will resolve current ambiguity that could lead to confusion in file operations and system maintenance.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: 2025-05-17
**Last Active**: 2025-05-17
**Dependencies**: T9 (v6.2 implementation)

## Completion Criteria
- Add clear definition of Project Root and Memory Bank Root
- Update directory structure documentation with absolute/relative path clarification
- Add path resolution rules for file operations
- Add validation rules for project structure
- Update all file path examples to demonstrate correct usage
- Review and update any affected command documentation

## Progress
1. ✅ Draft directory structure clarification additions
2. ✅ Update directory structure documentation
3. ✅ Add path resolution specifications
4. ✅ Update file operation examples
5. ✅ Review and update affected documentation

## Completion Notes
Task completed on 2025-05-17. All clarifications regarding project root and memory bank directory structure have been successfully implemented in v6.4 of the rules. Key improvements:
- Added clear Project Root and Memory Bank Root definitions
- Implemented explicit path resolution rules
- Updated directory structure visualization
- Added validation rules for project structure
- Created v6.4 with all clarifications incorporated

## Context
The current v6.3 specification lacks clear distinction between project root directory and memory bank system location. This ambiguity can lead to confusion when:
- Looking for specific files (tasks, templates, etc.)
- Implementing new memory bank instances
- Maintaining multiple projects using the memory bank system
- Writing file operation commands

The clarification will establish clear rules for:
1. Project root identification and specification
2. Memory bank location requirements
3. Path resolution rules
4. Directory naming constraints
