## Context
This task emerged from practical issues encountered during rules usage:

**Format Issues Resolved:**
- edit_history.md format was unclear about date/time structure
- Confusion about whether entries should be appended or prepended
- Inconsistent guidance on entry placement

**Size Optimization Completed:**
- v6.4 file exceeded 5000 token target
- Successfully condensed while maintaining all critical information
- Identified and reduced verbose sections without losing clarity

**Key Improvements Made:**
- Clear date format: `### YYYY-MM-DD` with blank line after
- Time entries: `#### HH:MM - TaskID: Description`
- Explicit prepending instructions for new entries
- Streamlined verbose sections (Implementation Scope Control, Task Flow, File Operations)
- Enhanced format requirements documentation

## Success Metrics
- **Token Efficiency**: Maintain all rule versions under 5000 tokens
- **Clarity**: Clear, unambiguous instructions for all procedures
- **Consistency**: Consistent formatting and requirements across versions
- **Usability**: Rules that work effectively in practice
- **Completeness**: No loss of essential functionality during optimization

## Ongoing Maintenance Areas
- **Format Consistency**: Ensure all templates and examples follow established patterns
- **Token Management**: Monitor file sizes during updates and additions
- **Practical Testing**: Validate rules work effectively in real usage scenarios
- **Version Coordination**: Maintain compatibility between different rule versions
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate practical usage insights into rule improvements

## Notes
This task represents the essential but often overlooked work of maintaining documentation systems. Good rules require ongoing attention to remain effective, clear, and efficient.

The balance between comprehensiveness and conciseness is ongoing - rules must be complete enough to provide clear guidance while remaining accessible and not overwhelming to process.

Success in this task directly impacts the effectiveness of all other memory bank operations, making it a foundational maintenance responsibility.
