# Changelog: Memory Bank System

## April 8, 2025 - Initial Setup
- Created dedicated memory-bank subfolder within the project
- Established Memory Bank core structure with all required files
- Implemented tiered documentation approach
- Set up progressive loading framework
- Created session continuity mechanism
- Documented system architecture and patterns

### Key Decisions
- **Progressive Loading**: Adopted a tiered approach to documentation to optimize token usage
- **Session Continuity**: Implemented session_cache.md for maintaining context across sessions
- **Command System**: Created explicit commands for controlling information flow
- **Differential Updates**: Established patterns for minimizing token usage during updates

### Design Choices
- Selected Markdown as the primary documentation format for readability and portability
- Organized files in a hierarchical structure to facilitate clear information flow
- Implemented explicit commands rather than automatic mechanisms to provide user control
- Used a directory-based approach for organizing documentation

### Future Considerations
- Potential for additional specialized documentation for complex features
- Possible enhancements to the command system for more granular control
- Exploration of metadata approaches for better cross-referencing
- Investigation of visualization tools for system state representation
