# Changelog: Memory Bank System

## April 8, 2025 (10:00) - Integration with Code Rules
- Created integrated-rules.md file that combines Code Rules and Memory Bank system
- Implemented comprehensive XML tag format for tool usage
- Expanded command system to include task execution and code implementation
- Added detailed documentation standards for consistent project knowledge
- Integrated workflow diagrams for task-first implementation and session management
- Added MCP server integration specifications

### Key Decisions
- **Unified System**: Combined Code Rules and Memory Bank into a single integrated system
- **Task-First Approach**: Prioritized immediate task execution with minimal context loading
- **Expanded Tool Usage**: Added detailed XML tag formatting for all tool operations
- **Workflow Integration**: Created clear flowcharts for implementation and session management

### Design Enhancements
- Added detailed file operation specifications including diff format for surgical edits
- Expanded documentation standards with status indicators and heading conventions
- Created templates for session_cache.md and activeContext.md with task-oriented focus
- Implemented Documentation Decision Framework for targeted updates

## April 8, 2025 - Initial Setup
- Created dedicated memory-bank subfolder within the project
- Established Memory Bank core structure with all required files
- Implemented tiered documentation approach
- Set up progressive loading framework
- Created session continuity mechanism
- Documented system architecture and patterns

### Key Decisions
- **Progressive Loading**: Adopted a tiered approach to documentation to optimize token usage
- **Session Continuity**: Implemented session_cache.md for maintaining context across sessions
- **Command System**: Created explicit commands for controlling information flow
- **Differential Updates**: Established patterns for minimizing token usage during updates

### Design Choices
- Selected Markdown as the primary documentation format for readability and portability
- Organized files in a hierarchical structure to facilitate clear information flow
- Implemented explicit commands rather than automatic mechanisms to provide user control
- Used a directory-based approach for organizing documentation

### Future Considerations
- Potential for additional specialized documentation for complex features
- Possible enhancements to the command system for more granular control
- Exploration of metadata approaches for better cross-referencing
- Investigation of visualization tools for system state representation
