# Recommended Migration Plan: Relational Database with Prisma ORM

*Date: April 15, 2025*

This plan outlines the recommended approach for migrating the memory bank from structured markdown files to a relational database managed by Prisma ORM, aiming for long-term efficiency, scalability, and maintainability, particularly for optimizing LLM interactions.

## Rationale

This approach is recommended because:

1.  **Structured Data &amp; Type Safety:** Enforces a clear schema via Prisma, improving data integrity and providing type safety during development.
2.  **Efficient Querying:** Leverages relational database strengths for structured queries and Prisma's API for easy access. JSONB fields offer flexibility for content. Enables fetching specific data snippets instead of whole files.
3.  **Scalability:** Prisma facilitates migration from simpler databases (like SQLite) to more robust ones (like PostgreSQL) as needs grow.
4.  **Maintainability:** Prisma's migration system simplifies schema evolution. Type safety reduces long-term maintenance effort.
5.  **Reduced LLM Token Usage:** An MCP server acts as an intermediary, providing fine-grained API endpoints. The LLM interacts with these endpoints, which translate requests into efficient database queries, minimizing data transfer and token consumption.

## Migration Steps

1.  **Define Schema:**
    *   Analyze existing markdown files (`session_cache.md`, `edit_history.md`, `errorLog.md`, `activeContext.md`, etc.).
    *   Design relational tables (e.g., `Sessions`, `Tasks`, `Edits`, `Errors`, `Contexts`).
    *   Use appropriate data types, including JSONB fields for flexible content storage.
    *   Define relationships between tables.
    *   Create a `schema.prisma` file reflecting this design.

2.  **Setup Database &amp; Prisma:**
    *   Choose a database (PostgreSQL recommended for scalability, SQLite for initial simplicity).
    *   Install Prisma CLI and Prisma Client (`npm install prisma @prisma/client --save-dev`).
    *   Initialize Prisma (`npx prisma init`).
    *   Run initial database migration (`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`).

    *   **Future Migration Considerations:** Starting with SQLite is feasible for initial development.
        *   **Migrating to PostgreSQL:** This is relatively straightforward using Prisma. The process involves updating the `provider` in `schema.prisma`, changing the database connection string, running Prisma migrations against the new PostgreSQL database, and scripting the data transfer from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
        *   **Migrating to MongoDB:** This is significantly more complex due to the fundamental difference between relational (SQLite/PostgreSQL) and document (MongoDB) data models. It would require a substantial redesign of the Prisma schema, writing complex data transformation scripts, and potentially adapting data access patterns in the MCP server.

3.  **Develop Conversion Scripts:**
    *   Create scripts (e.g., using Node.js with `gray-matter`, `remark`) to parse existing markdown files.
    *   Extract metadata and content according to the defined schema.
    *   Use Prisma Client within scripts to insert parsed data into the database.

4.  **Data Migration:**
    *   Run conversion scripts to populate the database.
    *   Verify data integrity post-migration.

5.  **Build MCP Server:**
    *   Create an MCP server application (e.g., Node.js/Express).
    *   Use Prisma Client for database interaction.
    *   Define MCP tool endpoints for specific actions (e.g., `get_latest_session_cache`, `add_edit_history_entry`, `get_errors`, `update_active_context`).
    *   Ensure endpoints return minimal, relevant data.

6.  **Integrate LLM with MCP Server:**
    *   Update LLM workflow/rules to use the new MCP server tools via `<use_mcp_tool>` instead of direct file operations for memory bank management.

7.  **(Optional) Archiving/Deprecating Markdown:**
    *   Once the new system is stable, archive or deprecate the original markdown files in `/memory-bank/`. They should no longer be the primary source of truth for the LLM.

8.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   Thoroughly test the MCP server endpoints and LLM integration.
    *   Monitor performance and token usage.
    *   Refine schema, queries, and endpoints as needed.
