# Project Brief: Memory Bank System

## Overview
The Memory Bank is a structured documentation system designed to maintain perfect project knowledge across chat sessions. It uses a progressive loading approach to optimize token usage while preserving critical context.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Progressive Loading System
- Implement tiered documentation access (Critical, Essential, Reference)
- Load only necessary files based on context requirements
- Support explicit commands for controlling document loading

### 2. Session Continuity
- Maintain context across multiple chat sessions
- Use session_cache.md for temporary continuity information
- Support differential updates to minimize token usage

### 3. Documentation Structure
- Maintain a clear hierarchy of documentation files
- Provide cross-references between related components
- Organize content to facilitate quick context retrieval

### 4. Command System
- Support explicit commands for reading memory bank files
- Enable targeted updates of specific files
- Provide session management commands

## Project Scope
The Memory Bank system will serve as a meta-documentation system for itself, demonstrating the principles and practices it aims to establish. It will focus on:

1. Establishing a robust documentation structure
2. Implementing the progressive loading mechanism
3. Creating the session continuity system
4. Demonstrating effective knowledge management across sessions

## Success Criteria
- Complete documentation structure with all required files
- Functional progressive loading system
- Effective session continuity mechanism
- Clear demonstration of the Memory Bank system's capabilities
