# Memory Bank Implementation Guidelines

## File Organization
- All Memory Bank files should be located in the `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/memory-bank/` directory
- Use Markdown format for all documentation files
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for all files

## Content Structure
- Each file should have a clear purpose and focus
- Use hierarchical headings (# for title, ## for major sections, ### for subsections)
- Include a "Last Updated" timestamp at the end of each file
- Cross-reference related information using relative links

## Progressive Loading Implementation
- Critical Tier files should contain only essential current context
- Essential Tier files should provide foundational information
- Reference Tier files should contain detailed technical information
- Avoid duplicating information across tiers

## Session Continuity Guidelines
- Use session_cache.md only for in-progress work
- Include clear status flags (COMPLETE or CONTINUING)
- List all files consulted during the session
- Provide sufficient context for continuation

## Update Patterns
- Update activeContext.md and progress.md after each significant change
- Make differential updates to minimize token usage
- Include timestamps for all updates
- Prefer small, focused updates over large rewrites

## Command Usage
- Use explicit read_mb commands when loading specific files
- Use update_mb commands when writing to specific files
- Use session commands to manage continuity
- Document all command patterns in changelog.md

## Documentation Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Prefer bullet points for lists of items
- Use tables for structured information
- Include examples for complex concepts
