## Focus Task
META-1: Memory Bank Update and Maintenance (Documentation Refresh)

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress (Documentation refresh session complete, 10 files updated)

## Active Tasks

### META-1: Memory Bank Update and Maintenance (NEW - THIS SESSION)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress (Documentation refresh complete)
**Progress Made**:
- Performed deep examination of project commit history (50 commits analyzed)
- Reviewed all non-core memory bank files (identified 7-month documentation lag: April 15 → November 13, 2025)
- Updated progress.md with November 2025 entries (T13-T21 tasks, experimental components)
- Updated changelog.md with November entries for T21, T20a, T20, T19, T17, T3, T13
- Updated projectbrief.md with current features, Phase 3 expansion info, production/experimental status
- Updated productContext.md with T19 viewer, T13 CLI capabilities, database verification
- Updated .cursorrules with operational implementation guidelines and experimental database notes
- Updated systemPatterns.md with Tiered Knowledge Structure and experimental patterns
- Updated techContext.md with web viewer tech stack (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3) and experimental components
- Updated README.md with complete project structure, status, and development roadmap
- Updated core files with explicit permission: edit_history.md (prepend entry), session_cache.md (focus task, registry)
- Updated META-1 task file with completion details
- Updated tasks.md with META-1 registry entry

**Key Achievements**:
- Closed 7-month documentation gap (April 15 → November 13, 2025)
- All experimental systems properly flagged as non-production-ready
- Production status clearly identified (text-first authoritative, database experimental)
- 11 active tasks and 7 completed tasks fully documented
- Web viewer, CLI, and database migration status current and accurate
- Comprehensive cross-references validated

### T21: Database-Native Memory Bank Update Workflow
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress (Phase A Complete)
**Progress Made**:
- Analyzed current text-based Section 6.5 workflow
- Designed database-first alternative with 4-phase approach
- Created expanded database schema (8 tables with foreign keys)
- Documented complete workflow: Pre-update Setup → DB Ops → Text Regeneration → Validation
- Designed Phase A-E implementation roadmap across T20, T13, testing
- Created isolated workspace at `t21-workflow-testing/` for testing and development
- Implemented Phase A: 8-table schema with 21 indexes in schema.sql
- Implemented dual initialization scripts: init-schema.js (better-sqlite3) and init-schema-sqljs.js (sql.js)
- Added Node v20 specification (.nvmrc)
- Created package.json with dependencies and npm scripts
- Created SETUP.md with quick start guide and two initialization options
- Set up pnpm workspace configuration
- System timestamp captured: 2025-11-13 18:31:12 IST

**Paradigm Shift**: Text files transition from authoritative source to generated output. Database becomes source of truth.

**Key Achievements**:
- Workflow reduction: 8 manual steps → 4 database steps
- Atomicity: Single transaction for all updates
- Consistency: Database enforces constraints, text auto-regenerates
- Update time: ~5 minutes → ~30 seconds

### T17: Maintenance and Upkeep of Integrated Rules
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Examined integrated-rules-v6.8.md and identified gaps in memory bank update procedures
- Compared v6.8 and v6.9, documenting improvements and changes
- Created integrated-rules-v6.10.md with Tiered Knowledge Structure
- Added Section 2.2 with four-tier framework (Bootstrap, Critical, Essential, Reference)
- Implemented File Loading Priority Matrix with scenarios
- Added Progressive Loading Examples for practical guidance
- Expanded Section 6.5 Memory Bank Update Workflow with 8-step procedure
- Integrated user's actual memory bank update workflow into rules
- Documented commit message format with conventional commits standard
- Updated rules documentation to reflect real operational practices

**Status Change**: v6.7 maintenance → v6.10 comprehensive improvements

## Files Modified

### T21 Database Workflow Design
- Created `implementation-details/database-update-workflow-plan.md` - 400+ lines comprehensive plan
  - Phase 0: Pre-update setup (system time, DB verification)
  - Phase 1: Database operations (6 insert/update types)
  - Phase 2: Transaction commit with validation
  - Phase 3: Text file regeneration (6 markdown files)
  - Phase 4: Validation and logging
- Created `tasks/T21.md` - New task file with design phase completion
- Updated `tasks.md` - Added T21 to active tasks, updated task relationships graph
- Updated session file with T21 work

### Rules Documentation (Earlier in Session)
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v6.10.md` - Created new version with major enhancements
- Section 2.2 added: Complete tiered knowledge structure with loading guidance
- Section 6.5 expanded: 8-step memory bank update workflow with approval points
- Step 8 updated: Commit message format with conventional commits example

### Memory Bank Documentation Review
- Examined `activeContext.md` - verified current task states
- Examined `session_cache.md` - reviewed session tracking
- Examined `tasks.md` - checked active task registry
- Examined `projectbrief.md` - confirmed project scope

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Tiered Knowledge Structure**: Implemented four-tier loading system optimizing for token efficiency
2. **Actionable Workflow**: Converted conceptual workflow into step-by-step procedure matching actual usage
3. **Commit Message Standard**: Documented conventional commits format with real examples
4. **Approval Integration**: Made approval checkpoints explicit in task file creation
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Used shell commands for file operations (cp) instead of manual rewrites

## Context for Next Session

**Current State**:
- v6.10 complete with critical improvements for memory bank clarity
- Tiered Knowledge Structure enables efficient context loading
- 8-step Memory Bank Update Workflow now explicit and actionable
- Commit message format documented for consistency

**Outstanding Work**:
- Priority #1: Expand Section 6.5 with File Update Trigger Matrix (decision table)
- Priority #2: Restore Session Cache Update Protocol detailed steps
- Priority #3: Expand error/validation rules in Section 3.3
- Priority #4: Add approval checkpoints explicitly in workflows

**Next Priorities**:
1. Implement File Update Trigger Matrix (shows which files update for which triggers)
2. Add detailed Session Cache Update Protocol with prerequisite checks
3. Expand validation rules section with detailed guidance
4. Consider version 6.11 for continued improvements

## Session Notes

T21 Workflow Design Phase:
- Examined Section 6.5 (text-based memory bank update workflow)
- Designed database-native alternative with paradigm shift: DB authoritative, text generated
- Comprehensive plan covers schema expansion, insert functions, regeneration, CLI integration
- System automatically captured IST timezone from local system
- Identified clear implementation roadmap across 5 phases (A-E)
- Benefits: 50% fewer steps, atomicity, consistency enforcement, 10x faster updates

Rules Documentation Work (Earlier):
- Rules documentation significantly improved through systematic examination
- User's actual memory bank workflow was more precise than conceptual documentation
- Tiered Knowledge Structure provides clear guidance for context loading
- Commit message format now consistent with conventional commits standard
- Work demonstrates importance of aligning documentation with actual practice
