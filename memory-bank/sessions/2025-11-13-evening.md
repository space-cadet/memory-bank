## Focus Task
T17 (Maintenance and Upkeep of Integrated Rules): Rules Documentation Enhancements - v6.8 to v6.10 Progression

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

## Active Tasks

### T17: Maintenance and Upkeep of Integrated Rules
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Examined integrated-rules-v6.8.md and identified gaps in memory bank update procedures
- Compared v6.8 and v6.9, documenting improvements and changes
- Created integrated-rules-v6.10.md with Tiered Knowledge Structure
- Added Section 2.2 with four-tier framework (Bootstrap, Critical, Essential, Reference)
- Implemented File Loading Priority Matrix with scenarios
- Added Progressive Loading Examples for practical guidance
- Expanded Section 6.5 Memory Bank Update Workflow with 8-step procedure
- Integrated user's actual memory bank update workflow into rules
- Documented commit message format with conventional commits standard
- Updated rules documentation to reflect real operational practices

**Status Change**: v6.7 maintenance → v6.10 comprehensive improvements

## Files Modified

### Rules Documentation
- `/Users/deepak/code/memory-bank/integrated-rules-v6.10.md` - Created new version with major enhancements
- Section 2.2 added: Complete tiered knowledge structure with loading guidance
- Section 6.5 expanded: 8-step memory bank update workflow with approval points
- Step 8 updated: Commit message format with conventional commits example

### Memory Bank Documentation Review
- Examined `activeContext.md` - verified current task states
- Examined `session_cache.md` - reviewed session tracking
- Examined `tasks.md` - checked active task registry
- Examined `projectbrief.md` - confirmed project scope

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Tiered Knowledge Structure**: Implemented four-tier loading system optimizing for token efficiency
2. **Actionable Workflow**: Converted conceptual workflow into step-by-step procedure matching actual usage
3. **Commit Message Standard**: Documented conventional commits format with real examples
4. **Approval Integration**: Made approval checkpoints explicit in task file creation
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Used shell commands for file operations (cp) instead of manual rewrites

## Context for Next Session

**Current State**:
- v6.10 complete with critical improvements for memory bank clarity
- Tiered Knowledge Structure enables efficient context loading
- 8-step Memory Bank Update Workflow now explicit and actionable
- Commit message format documented for consistency

**Outstanding Work**:
- Priority #1: Expand Section 6.5 with File Update Trigger Matrix (decision table)
- Priority #2: Restore Session Cache Update Protocol detailed steps
- Priority #3: Expand error/validation rules in Section 3.3
- Priority #4: Add approval checkpoints explicitly in workflows

**Next Priorities**:
1. Implement File Update Trigger Matrix (shows which files update for which triggers)
2. Add detailed Session Cache Update Protocol with prerequisite checks
3. Expand validation rules section with detailed guidance
4. Consider version 6.11 for continued improvements

## Session Notes

- Rules documentation was significantly improved through systematic examination and enhancement
- User's actual memory bank workflow was more precise than conceptual documentation
- Tiered Knowledge Structure provides clear guidance for context loading
- Commit message format now consistent with conventional commits standard
- Work demonstrates importance of aligning documentation with actual practice
