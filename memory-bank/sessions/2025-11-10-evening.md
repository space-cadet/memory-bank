## Focus Task
**T19**: Memory Bank Viewer Web Interface (Planning Complete)

## Work Summary
- Completed comprehensive planning for Memory Bank Viewer
- Designed dual file discovery approaches (scan script + server)
- Documented complete architecture and implementation strategy
- Planned folder structure in memory-bank/viewer/
- Designed three viewing modes: chronological, task-wise, topic-wise

## Active Tasks
### T19: Memory Bank Viewer Web Interface
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress
**Priority:** HIGH
**Progress**:
1. ✅ Complete architecture planning and design
   - Designed dual approach implementation
   - Planned folder structure (memory-bank/viewer/)
   - Defined file discovery strategies
   - Created detailed plan document
2. 🔄 Implementation Phase 1: Core infrastructure (next)
3. ⬜ Implementation Phase 2: View rendering
4. ⬜ Implementation Phase 3: Advanced features

## Context and Working State
Completed comprehensive planning session for Memory Bank Viewer. Key decisions made:
- Single HTML file with embedded everything (no build process)
- Dual file discovery approaches for flexibility and testing
- Separate viewer/ folder to avoid cluttering main memory-bank
- Three independent viewing modes with unified search
- Auto-detection of available file discovery method in HTML

User opted to implement both file discovery approaches (scan script and server) to test both and decide which to standardize on. This provides flexibility and empirical evidence for the best approach.

## Critical Files
- `tasks/T19.md` - Task details and progress
- `implementation-details/memory-bank-viewer.md` - Complete architecture documentation
- `viewer/viewer.html` (to be created) - Main single-file viewer
- `viewer/generate-manifest.js` (to be created) - Scan script
- `viewer/server.js` (to be created) - Minimal Node server

## Session Notes
- Planning complete and documented
- Ready to begin Phase 1 (core infrastructure) in next session
- Both launcher scripts needed for easy startup
- README.md will provide clear setup instructions for both approaches
- HTML will auto-detect which approach is available (graceful fallback)

## Next Steps
1. Create viewer folder structure in memory-bank/viewer/
2. Implement generate-manifest.js (scan script)
3. Implement server.js (Node server)
4. Create viewer.html with auto-detection logic
5. Create launcher scripts and README
6. Test both file discovery approaches
