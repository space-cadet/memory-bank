**Time Spent**: 45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### T17: Maintenance and Upkeep of Integrated Rules
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Identified and analyzed session cache overwriting problem causing data gaps (Jun 9-19)
- Designed comprehensive solution plan integrating session file creation and workflow clarity
- Created integrated rules v6.7 with mandatory session cache update protocol
- Added Section 2.10 Session Cache Update Protocol with required sequence enforcement
- Added Section 2.11 Core File Update Workflows with trigger matrix for all files
- Enhanced Section 6.4 session management commands with clear file modification requirements
- Added Section 9.5 Individual Session File Template with detailed format requirements
- Updated Critical Compliance Requirements with session cache violation rules
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (Advanced)

## Files Modified
- `integrated-rules-v6.7.md` - Created comprehensive update with session workflow fixes
- `integrated-rules-v6.6.md` - Used as source for v6.7 creation

## Key Decisions Made
- Implemented mandatory session file creation before session cache updates to prevent data loss
- Added comprehensive workflow matrix covering all core memory bank files
- Established clear violation consequences for session cache mishandling
- Standardized session file naming and permanent record keeping

## Context for Next Session
The v6.7 rules now provide clear guidance to prevent session cache overwriting issues. The new protocol requires creating individual session files before updating cache, preserving session history permanently. Core file workflows are now documented with clear triggers and update methods.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Test v6.7 rules in practice to validate session workflow improvements
2. Monitor compliance with new session file creation requirements
3. Consider additional workflow improvements based on usage patterns
