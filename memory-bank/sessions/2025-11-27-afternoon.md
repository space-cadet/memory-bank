## Focus Tasks
T13: Implement Memory Bank CLI - Parser Execution & Modular Refactor
T21: Database-Native Memory Bank Update Workflow - Parser Scripts Integration

**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Active Tasks

### T13: Implement Memory Bank CLI
**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (90% Complete)
**Progress**:
1. ✅ Fixed parse operation exclusive checks (removed component flag restrictions)
2. ✅ Fixed startViewer operation exclusive checks for consistency
3. ✅ Updated PARSER_SCRIPTS constant to include all 6 scripts
4. ✅ Implemented actual parser execution in option 4
5. ✅ Added auto-dependency installation check
6. ✅ Added sequential parser execution with progress output
7. ✅ Fixed component summary display (multiple target directories)
8. ✅ Created modular lib structure:
   - `lib/validators.js` - File/directory validation functions
   - `lib/parsers.js` - Parser execution logic
   - `lib/prompts.js` - Interactive menu logic
   - `lib/writers.js` - Template generation functions

### T21: Database-Native Memory Bank Update Workflow
**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (Phase A Complete, Parser Scripts Added)
**Progress**:
1. ✅ Copied all 4 parser scripts to T21 folder for consistency
2. ✅ Copied 2 query scripts to T21 folder
3. ✅ Enhanced server.js:
   - Changed default database from test_memory_bank.db to memory_bank.db
   - Added --help flag with comprehensive usage documentation
   - Added --port flag for custom port configuration
4. ✅ Fixed CSS file path mismatch (styles.css → style.css)

## Context and Working State

**Session Goals:**
- Fix CLI init script issues identified during testing
- Ensure parser execution works correctly
- Improve server.js usability
- Begin modular refactor of init.js

**Key Decisions:**
- Parser scripts should be in T21 folder for CLI to copy from canonical source
- Server should default to memory_bank.db to match parser output
- Modular architecture improves maintainability
- Full init.js refactor deferred to next session

**Issues Resolved:**
1. Parse operation only showed instructions, didn't execute
2. Server.js looked for wrong database file by default
3. CSS file had incorrect filename in init script
4. Init script had monolithic structure

- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated timestamps and status
- `memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Updated current session

## Session Notes

Productive session fixing critical CLI issues discovered during real-world testing. The parse operation was only showing instructions instead of executing, which is now fixed. Created modular architecture foundation that will make future CLI development much cleaner.

Server.js improvements make it more user-friendly with proper defaults and help documentation. Parser scripts are now consistently available in T21 folder as the canonical source.

Full modular refactor of init.js will be tackled in next session to complete the architectural improvement.
