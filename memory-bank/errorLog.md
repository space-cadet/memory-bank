## 2025-04-14 16:30 UTC: T1 - Context Loss When Switching Tasks

**File:** `memory-bank/session_cache.md`

**Error Description:**
When switching between multiple tasks, context about other ongoing changes was being lost because the session cache was structured around a single task.

**Cause:**
The session_cache.md template was designed with a single "Current Task" and "Current Step" structure, without support for preserving context across multiple concurrent tasks.

**Fix:**
1. Implemented a multi-task design for session_cache.md
2. Created a task registry (tasks.md) to track all tasks
3. Updated templates and files to include task ID references
4. Modified workflows to preserve context when switching between tasks

**Key Changes:**
```markdown
# Before:
## Current Task
[Single task description]

## Current Step
[Single step description]

# After:
## Overview
- Active Tasks: [Count]
- Last Task Focus: [Task ID]

## Active Tasks
### [Task ID 1]: [Task Title]
[Task-specific context]

### [Task ID 2]: [Task Title]
[Task-specific context]
```

**Affected Files:**
- `integrated-rules-v4.md`
