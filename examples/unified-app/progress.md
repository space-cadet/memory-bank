## Update: April 4, 2025

After reviewing the current codebase, here is an updated status:

### Typing Tutor Integration
- ✅ Module structure created in src/modules/typing-tutor
- ✅ Core components migrated:
  - TypingChallenge
  - VisualKeyboard
  - FingerGuidance
  - ProgressIndicator
  - SpeedIndicator
  - Lesson sidebar components
- ✅ Contexts and hooks organized in appropriate directories

### Animal Sounds Module
- ❌ Module structure not yet created in unified app
- ❌ AnimalSounds component not yet migrated
- ❌ Animal assets not yet moved to public directory

### Authentication Implementation
- ✅ Auth provider context with localStorage implementation
- ✅ Basic login/signup UI components
- ❌ Provider-agnostic auth layer (design exists but implementation pending)
- ❌ JSON Server integration for more robust development auth

### Next Immediate Priorities
1. Create module structure for Animal Sounds in src/modules/animal-sounds
2. Migrate AnimalSounds component from Child's First App
3. Update image references to use local assets
4. Integrate with unified navigation system
5. Implement provider-agnostic auth layer based on design document
6. Install dependencies using pnpm

### Remaining Technical Debt
- Project dependencies not yet installed with pnpm
- Authentication relies on mock data only, needs proper implementation
- Need to establish a shared progress tracking system
- Need to implement a consistent navigation system between modules


## Update: April 4, 2025

### Recent Changes
- ✅ Fixed incorrect button labels in the Typing Tutor module:
  - Swapped "Progress History" and "Lessons & Settings" labels to match their actual functions
- ✅ Added debugging functionality to the Typing Tutor module:
  - Added "Auto Complete" button for testing lesson completion
  - Added "Reset All Data" button for clearing progress data
  - Positioned debug buttons in a non-intrusive location at bottom right

These changes support easier testing and demonstration of the typing tutor functionality without affecting the core user experience.
