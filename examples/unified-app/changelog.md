### Project Status Assessment
- Conducted a comprehensive review of the codebase to assess current state
- Verified the successful migration of Typing Tutor module
- Confirmed that Animal Sounds module migration has not yet started
- Identified the current structure and organization patterns of modules

### Memory Bank Updates
- Updated activeContext.md with current project status and next priorities

- Navigation between modules and shared progress tracking are key priorities

### Next Steps
- Migrate Animal Sounds module following the established pattern
- Implement provider-agnostic auth layer based on the design document
