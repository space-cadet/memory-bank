After reviewing the codebase, here is the current status of the project:

1. **Project Structure**: The Next.js application structure is in place with core directories (app, components, hooks, lib, modules, shared).

2. **Module Integration**: 
   - Typing Tutor has been successfully migrated to the unified application
   - Animal Sounds module (from Child's First App) migration is still pending

3. **Authentication System**:
   - Basic authentication UI is implemented
   - Mock authentication with localStorage is functional
   - The provider-agnostic auth layer design is documented but not fully implemented

4. **Navigation & Dashboard**:
   - Basic route structure with auth and dashboard routes is set up
   - Dashboard skeletons for parent and child views exist

5. **Current Focus Areas**:
   - Migrating the Animal Sounds component from Child's First App
   - Implementing the provider-agnostic authentication layer
   - Completing the navigation system between modules
   - Developing a shared progress tracking system

6. **Dependencies**:
   - Project dependencies need to be installed using pnpm

The next priority is migrating the Animal Sounds module while maintaining its core functionality and adapting it to the unified platform's design system.
