## Design Decisions

### Authentication Implementation
- **Decision**: Use NextAuth.js for authentication
- **Context**: Need for secure, flexible authentication with multiple provider support
- **Alternatives Considered**: Custom authentication system, Firebase Auth, Auth0
- **Reason**: NextAuth.js provides excellent integration with Next.js and supports multiple providers

### Dashboard Architecture
- **Decision**: Use client-side dashboard with dynamic component loading
- **Context**: Simplifies initial development and allows for more flexible UI updates
- **Alternatives Considered**: Server components with React Server Components
- **Reason**: Client-side approach provides better interactivity for the dashboard

### Settings Architecture
- **Decision**: Use React Context API with schema-based settings approach
- **Context**: Need for type-safe, globally accessible settings with persistence
- **Alternatives Considered**: Redux, Zustand, prop drilling, server-side storage
- **Reason**: Context provides simplicity while still enabling global state access with proper typing

### UI Component Library
- **Decision**: Use shadcn/ui for consistent component design
- **Context**: Need for accessible, customizable components that work well with Next.js
- **Alternatives Considered**: MUI, Chakra UI, raw Tailwind
- **Reason**: shadcn/ui provides the right balance of flexibility, design quality, and integration with Tailwind

### State Management
- **Decision**: Start with React's built-in state management (useState, useContext)
- **Context**: Current application complexity doesn't warrant additional libraries
- **Alternatives Considered**: Redux, Zustand, Jotai
- **Reason**: Keep the stack lightweight initially; can introduce more advanced state management as needed

### Layout Strategy
- **Decision**: Use a collapsible sidebar with main content area
- **Context**: Need to maximize screen space while maintaining easy navigation
- **Alternatives Considered**: Top navigation, tab-based interface
- **Reason**: Sidebar provides better scalability for adding new applications

### Styling Approach
- **Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Context**: Need for consistent, responsive design with minimal CSS overhead
- **Alternatives Considered**: CSS Modules, Styled Components
- **Reason**: Tailwind provides rapid development capabilities and works well with the chosen component library

### Application Integration Approach
- **Decision**: Implement multiple specialized applications instead of just three
- **Context**: Broader range of user needs identified during development
- **Alternatives Considered**: Focusing only on the original three applications
- **Reason**: Providing a more comprehensive suite of tools creates greater value for users

## Future Plans
