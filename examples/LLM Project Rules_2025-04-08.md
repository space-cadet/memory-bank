# Core Constraints & Safety:

## Scope Limitation:

1. MUST operate exclusively within the designated project directory and its subdirectories.
2. MUST NOT access, read, or modify files or directories outside this defined scope, without explicit user approval.

## Action Restrictions:

1. MUST NOT execute shell commands or scripts unless they are solely for:
2. Listing directory contents (prefer internal tools like list_files if available).
3. Navigating directories (use with caution, prefer specifying full paths in tool parameters).
4. Performing file read/write/modification operations using designated tools (e.g., read_file, write_to_file, apply_diff), not shell redirection (>, cat, etc.).
5. Any other command execution (e.g., build, test, run commands) requires explicit, step-by-step user approval before execution.

# Operational Procedure & Approval:

## Mandatory Plan & Step-Approval:

1. MUST first propose a clear, step-by-step plan for any task involving code generation, file modification, or command execution.
2. MUST wait for explicit user approval of the overall plan.
3. MUST wait for explicit user approval for each individual step within the plan before executing that step. Do not proceed to the next step without approval.

## Targeted Focus:

When feasible and aligned with the approved plan, prioritize analyzing and modifying only the necessary files/components directly related to the task, rather than conducting broad, unnecessary project-wide scans.

# Memory Bank Optimization:

## Progressive Loading:

1. By default, only load Critical Tier files (activeContext.md, progress.md) at session start.
2. Check for session_cache.md to detect continuing sessions.
3. Load additional files only when specifically required for the current task.
4. Respond to explicit memory bank commands for loading and updating.

## Session Continuity:

1. Use session_cache.md to maintain context across multiple chat sessions.
2. Create lightweight cache updates instead of full memory bank updates for continuing sessions.
3. Use differential updates to minimize token usage during memory bank updates.
4. Honor explicit session commands (continue_session, complete_session, cache_session).

## Memory Bank Commands:

1. Support explicit commands for controlling memory bank interaction:
   - `read_mb` - Read default Critical tier files
   - `read_mb standard` - Load Critical + Essential tiers
   - `read_mb complete` - Load all Memory Bank files
   - `read_mb [file1] [file2]` - Load specific files only
   - `update_mb` - Update only files with meaningful changes
   - `update_mb complete` - Update all Memory Bank files
   - `update_mb [file1] [file2]` - Update specific files only
   - `continue_session` - Flag that this is a continuation, prioritize session_cache.md
   - `complete_session` - Mark session as complete, update Memory Bank
   - `cache_session` - Create continuation point with minimal updates

# Guidelines & Preferences:

## Simplicity Principle:

SHOULD favor simple, clear, and maintainable solutions over unnecessarily complex ones.

## Memory Bank Usage:

Consulting the memory-bank is optimized to minimize token usage while maintaining context. Follow the progressive loading approach and session continuity mechanism.

## LaTeX Formatting:

1. MUST enclose inline LaTeX equations within single dollar signs (`$...$`).
2. MUST enclose display math equations within double dollar signs (`$$...$$`).
